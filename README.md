# Carapuce JS Bot Discord

This repository is for my personnal discord bot. I've mostly did it by myself and most of string are in French.

The bot needs to have a config.json file like the following as the root of the repo:

```json
{
    "prefix": "Command's prefix (ex: !cara)",
    "token": "Bot's token",
    "ownerID": "Your ID : not Kevin#0000 but something like 012345678901234567",
    "whiteList": ["Authorised user's ID 1", "Authorised user's ID 2"]
}
```
